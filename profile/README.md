## Mazadak - An Auctions Marketplace

Mazadak is a microservices-based marketplace that combines auctions and 
fixed-price sales into a single marketplace. Unlike traditional e-commerce, buyers can 
either purchase products instantly at a set price or compete in real-time auctions to secure 
better deals. Sellers gain flexibility by choosing how to list items, while buyers get a 
dynamic and engaging shopping experience.
